        </div>
        <p>
            3G routers allow you to connect a USB dongle to the router just lik how we connect 
            ethernet cable connection to router. The user can connect the USB dongle as internet
            connection to the router and use the internet over Wi-Fi on mulitiple devices.
            <br>
            "Not every USB router is compatible with USB dongle internet support."
            <br>
            Normally when you see a router with a USB port, it could mean the port only supports
            hard disks or printers. If you are looking to buy a router that has USB dongle support,
            you should look for terms like "3G router", "USB dongle" in the specs.
            <br>

        <h3>How to Configure USB dongle as a Wi-Fi router</h3>
        <p>
            This is dependant on router and ISP provider, but here is a general process
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Connect the 3G dongle in USB slot</li>
                <li>Connect the router with LAN wire that you get with the router. The router cable
                    output wire goes as input wire to laptop.
                </li>
                <li>Open in your browser the link: http://192.168.1.1/ similar to it. Check your router 
                    installation guide on more details
                </li>
                <li>You can see router configuration page and specify your ISP provider. eg. Tata photon</li>
                <li>Enter recquired field and set a password</li>
            </ul>

            <b>What is identity theft?</b> <br>
            This is any kind of deception, scam, or crime that results inthe loss of personal data
            including loss of usernames, passwords, banking informaiton, credit card numbers, social security numbers
            and health ID's that is thenused without your permission to commit fraud or other crimes.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>How are identities stolen?</b> <br>
            People become victims of identity theft online when the fall for tactics like phishing and confidence
            scams or download malware in to their devices that steals information. In other cases like using 
            networks that are insecure, sharing passwords with untrustwirthy people.
            <br>

                <li>Protect your computer and smartphone with strong, up-to-date security software.</li>
                <li>Learn to spot spam and scams.</li>
                <li>Use strong passwords.</li>

        <h3>peer-to-peer networks and server networks</h3>
        <p>
            Peer to peer network and client-server network are the telecommunication networks 
            where the information is transferred from the source to the destination without 
            any loss or only minimal loss in transmission. In both these kinds of the network, 
            a path is used for transmission of the information. In the client-server network, 
            the path is dedicated but the peer-to-peer network does not have a dedicated path. 
            Let us read about these servers and the difference between peer to peer and 
            client-server.
        </p>
        <h3>Client server network</h3>
        <p>
           A client server network includes many clients or workstations that are connected 
           to at least one central server. Most of the data and the applications get installed 
           on the server. When the client wants access to the resources, they then access it 
           from the server. The server mostly has a private user directory as well as many 
           public directories. The client server network has faster speed access because these 
           are designed to support several clients. The client functions as a workstation without 
           sharing any of the resources. 
           <br>
           A client server network is a kind of online network that comprises of a single central computer 
           that behaves like a server and that directs various computes or clients to it. When the 
           server is accessed, clients can reach the shared information and files that are saved on 
           the computer serving it. The World Wide Web is an example of a computer application that 
           makes use of the client server model.
           <br>
           The nature of the application is what decides whether in the client server model 
           the computer is a client, a server, or acts like both of them.
        </p>
        <h3>Peer-to-peer</h3>
        <p>
            A peer-to-peer network is one that involves two or more than two computers that pool individual resources 
        like the printers, DVD players, and disk drivers. These are the shared resources that are available in 
        every computer in the network. Each of the computers will behave as the client as well as the server and 
        it communicates with the other computers directly. In the peer-to-peer network like for example the printer of 
        one of the computers can be used by any computer present in the particular network. It is 
        inexpensive to set up a peer-to-peer network.

        <h2 id="description">Description of the common functionality of server networks</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            A server network is a system in which multiple computers (clients) are connected to 
            a central server or group of servers that manage resources and services. One common 
            functionality of server networks is centralized data storage, where all files are 
            stored on the server, making it easier to manage, back up, and secure data. Another 
            key function is user authentication and access control, allowing administrators to 
             user permissions and ensure that only authorized users access specific files or 
             services. File sharing is made efficient through a server, enabling users to access 
             and collaborate on shared documents and software.  
             <br>
            Server networks also provide printer and hardware sharing, reducing the need for 
            every user to have their own device. Email hosting is often handled by servers, 
            supporting internal and external communication within an organization. Web hosting 
            database management are also commonly run through server networks, supporting 
            company websites and applications. Remote access is another important feature, 
            allowing users to log in and work from different locations securely.
